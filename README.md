# Build things quickly with Meteor
Demo app shown during my talk at 42 school and at La Base.

Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web
applications.

## Meteor?
With Meteor you write apps:

* in pure JavaScript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Try the getting started [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try).

Next, read the [guide](http://guide.meteor.com) or the reference documentation at http://docs.meteor.com/.

## How to use
Install Meteor:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
```

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xavcz/meteor-42.git
```

Run it:

```bash
cd meteor-42
meteor
```

By default, you will run on the master branch which is built with React. If you want to switch on the totally insecure version built with Blaze, switch branch :

```bash
git checkout blaze-version
```
